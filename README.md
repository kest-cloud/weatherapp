Project Title: Weather App


Project Description: This is a mobile application that track weather in a fashion manner for a rock'n'roll band staff.

The band staff needs to track the current weather and the forecast for the 5 next days of the main cities where shows of the tour are taking place:

Silverstone, UK
São Paulo, Brazil
Melbourne, Australia
Monte Carlo, Monaco

Why Flutter?

Flutter is a cross plateform effecient framework in building amazing mobile application. 
Flutter is faster than many other application development frameworks. With its “hot reload” feature, you can experiment, build UIs, add/remove features, test and fix bugs faster. Thus reducing the overall app development time.


My Archictecture and Model choice
Since this is a simple application, I made use of the setstate method to manage my state management. I am proficient in Provider and have considerable knowledge in Bloc/Cubit. 

I Seperated my files into Models, Services, ANd screens and followed the instruction to maintain just two screens for thei application.


Brief explaination on how this application works
Band  staff has two options... either they click the card for ther desire city or find weather for a particular city by searching in the search Textfield.
The result for the current screen pops up right below the search field and a button to display further weather details about city
will push users to the next screen(second screen). 


on the next screen, another button to confirm user request to get 3 hours/5days weather information for the particular city will fetch out that info when clicked. 






You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.





Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.



6. Include Credits



If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.





Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.





This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.



7. Add a License



For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.





We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.





The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/





Up to this point what we have covered are the minimum requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.



Additional README Sections

8. Badges



Badges aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.





Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...





Below is a screenshot from one of my projects that shows how you can make use of badges:
