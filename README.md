Project Title: Weather App


Project Description: This is a mobile application that track weather in a fashion manner for a rock'n'roll band staff.

The band staff needs to track the current weather and the forecast for the 5 next days of the main cities where shows of the tour are taking place:

Silverstone, UK
São Paulo, Brazil
Melbourne, Australia
Monte Carlo, Monaco

Why Flutter?

Flutter is a cross plateform effecient framework in building amazing mobile application. 
Flutter is faster than many other application development frameworks. With its “hot reload” feature, you can experiment, build UIs, add/remove features, test and fix bugs faster. Thus reducing the overall app development time.


My Archictecture and Model choice
Since this is a simple application, I made use of the setstate method to manage my state management. I am proficient in Provider and have considerable knowledge in Bloc/Cubit. 

I Seperated my files into Models, Services, ANd screens and followed the instruction to maintain just two screens for thei application.


Brief explaination on how this application works
Band  staff has two options... either they click the card for ther desire city or find weather for a particular city by searching in the search Textfield.
The result for the current screen pops up right below the search field and a button to display further weather details about city
will push users to the next screen(second screen). 


on the next screen, detailed weather information about city is displayed. 
Another button to confirm user request to get 3 hours/5days weather information for the particular city will fetch out that info when clicked.
